    <h1 class="section"> The NBA's Superheroes </h1>
    <p>When watching the NBA, it may seem like the players are superhuman. They fly through the air with
    the greatest of ease, and accomplish feats of skill that no mere mortal could dream of.
    </p>

    <p class = "stop_text"> Here, we'll explore the stories of these superheroes. </p>

    <div id = "scatterSection">
    <h2>Explore the Stats</h2>
    <p>Select a season below, and dive into the stats to see which players were the biggest heroes of that season.
        You can choose a stat to display on the x and y axes of the graph, and try to find players that you think have the most 
        outstanding stats. <br>
        Just hover over a player to see their name and their values of the statistics that you chose. 
        You can click on a player's dot to add them to your list of favorite players, whom we'll learn more about in
        the next few visualizations! Once you add some players, the next two visualizations will render and you can learn
        more about their stories. <br>

    <h2>My City Needs Me</h2>
    Every superhero has a hometown - a city that they use their powers to watch over and protect. 
    Which cities do your selected players call home? <br>
    The red dots on the map display the home city that your selected players played in during your selected season.
    Hover over a dot on the map to see which city it is and who played there!

    <h2>Teaming up:</h2>
    Often, superheroes decide to team up to make the most of their powers. NBA players are no exception. <br>

    Take a look at the plot below to see which players were your selected players' most loyal sidekicks throughout their entire careers.
    The turquoise nodes in the graph represent your selected players, and the orange nodes represent all the teammates that they played
    with during their career. The links represent a connection between one of your selected players and another player (or with another selected player).
    Two players will be linked if they played at least one season together. Note that these are connections across those players'
    whole careers, not just your selected season.<br>

    If the link between two players is thicker, that means they played more seasons together, and they were trusty sidekicks
    for a larger part of your hero's career. You can zoom and drag to see player's sidekicks in more detail. <br>

    <br>
    Click on one of the turquoise nodes to display the names of their teammates!

    <br>
    
    
    <div id="player_connections">
    
        </div>
        <div id="teammates_plot" class="center_plot">
        </div>
    </div>    
    <p>
        Note: if you only selected a few players, or if they haven't shared any teammates, they may be far apart on the graph. 
        Also note that many players only spent a few years together, so most links will be thin,
        but some have very strong friendships and thicker links.
